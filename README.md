# Visualizing_Gov_Nets
Repository for Developing an  R/Shiny App to display WQIN data

Review the project proposal for a brief explanation of the project.

## Data Wrangling

See the 'data wrangling report.docx' report for a general description.
See the 'ipython script prep 14aug17.ipynb' for the full data wrangling process.

## Milestone Report
Opening the report from here will not display the interactive map. Download and run in
Jupyter Notebook to see the interactive network map. If you do not have R installed,
then select and install RStudio from your Anaconda Navigator. This will install the
R kernel necessary to run this notebook.

After downloading, run the following line of code to install the packages used in the report:

`install.packages(c("dplyr","igraph","networkD3"))`

** This readme will be further developed as the project proceeds **
